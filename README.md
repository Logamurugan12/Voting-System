### **Simple Voting System in Java**

#### **Project Overview:**

This is a **Simple Voting System** implemented in **Core Java** that allows users to vote for candidates and displays the total number of votes for each candidate. The application runs in the terminal/command line and provides a basic text-based menu for interaction. The system stores votes in memory, allowing users to vote for different candidates and view the total number of votes for each candidate.

#### **Features:**

* **Vote for a Candidate**: Users can select a candidate and cast their vote.
* **View Total Votes**: Displays the total votes for each candidate.
* **Exit**: The user can exit the system at any time.
* **Basic Command-Line Interface**: The application runs in the terminal/command prompt.

#### **Technologies Used:**

* **Java SE** (Standard Edition)
* **Core Java Concepts**:

  * Arrays
  * Loops
  * Conditionals
  * User input handling (using the `Scanner` class)

#### **How It Works:**

1. **Voting Process**: Users select a candidate by entering the corresponding number from a list of candidates. The vote is then recorded for the selected candidate.
2. **View Total Votes**: After voting, users can view the total number of votes for each candidate.
3. **Menu**: The program presents a simple text-based menu with the following options:

   * Vote for a candidate
   * View total votes
   * Exit the program

#### **Installation and Running the Project:**

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-voting-system.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory** and compile the code:

   ```bash
   cd simple-voting-system
   javac VotingSystem.java
   ```

3. **Run the application**:

   ```bash
   java VotingSystem
   ```

4. **Interact with the system**:

   * Choose from the available options to vote, view votes, or exit.

#### **Example Interaction**:

```

#### **Future Enhancements**:

* **Persistence**: Store the votes in a file to retain the data after the application is closed.
* **Multiple Rounds of Voting**: Allow multiple rounds of voting or support multiple voters.
* **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Build a GUI for a more interactive experience, using **JavaFX** or **Swing**.
* **Dynamic Candidate Input**: Allow users to add new candidates dynamically or load them from an external file.
